## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **SQL** – Data extraction, transformation, and lifecycle profile building
* **Python** – Cohort analysis, customer segmentation, CLTV modeling
* **Tableau** – Interactive dashboard with forecasting, churn prediction, and what-if analysis

## 📌 Key Deliverables

### ✅ 1. Data Integration (SQL)

* Merged `customers.csv`, `subscriptions.csv`, `service_calls.csv`, and `campaigns.csv`
* Built unified customer profiles with lifecycle timelines
* Ensured temporal alignment for accurate monthly snapshot analysis

### ✅ 2. Advanced Analytics (Python)

* Performed **cohort analysis** for churn trends
* Identified **customer segments** by service mix, value, and behavior
* Analyzed **campaign effectiveness** on cross-sell and retention
* Quantified **impact of customer service** on churn risk
* Modeled **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** drivers

### ✅ 3. Tableau Dashboard

Interactive views include:

* 📈 Trends in churn and acquisition by service
* 👤 Lifecycle journey of segmented customer groups
* 📢 Campaign ROI and retention impact
* ☎️ Service quality metrics vs churn correlation
* 🔮 Predictive churn scores with “What-if” levers

### ✅ 4. Predictive Modeling (in Tableau)

* Identified high-risk customers and segments
* Forecasted churn rates by product line
* Included scenario modeling: service faults, promotions, etc.

### ✅ 5. Strategic Recommendations

Outlined data-driven strategies to:

* Reduce churn across TV, Broadband, and Mobile
* Optimize marketing spend and engagement
* Improve service responsiveness to enhance retention
